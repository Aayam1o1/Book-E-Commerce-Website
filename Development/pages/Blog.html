        Technology is a major factor in the lives of billons of people. Wherever we go, we see technology improving the lives of
        many people. However, as useful as technology is, it has a dark side that affects people in a dangerous and bad way. So, this
        leads us to the controversial question:Is technology a boon or a curse? and as mentioned above technology is a major factor 
        for many peoples so what can be the effects of it in a modern day socitey?

        <br>
        <br>

     <p style="padding-left:300px; padding-right: 280px">
         Technology has made major positive changes in the society. Technologty has helped a lot in many ways like in the time of 
         lockdown due to <span style="color: red;"><b>"corona virus"</b></span> all the schools had been shut down which hamppered a student study a lot. But with the help of modern technolgy school were able to provide education to the students with help of online classes. Where as student can also improve there learning with help of various apps like: <b>"My secondary teacher", "BYJU's", "Google Classroom"</b> and even clear the confusion themselves with help of google. With the help of technology, students understand what they are taught and can apply it in real life easily. Thanks to technology, school has become a place where students love to go.
         <br>
         <br>
         Not only in schools but technology has effects in various parts of a society.
         A phone is now an essential part of an individual as we can see everyone from child to an adult carrying a phone with themselves from which they can contact with their friends, relatives and many more, an individual can also kill there boredom by playing games reading books online. Its only thanks to the technology we students are able to make website like this which would be impossible without the modern technology. 

         <br>
         <br>
         One of the fact given by <b>"tech care company Asurion"</b> says that on average a person check there smartphones 96 times per day which is equivalent to checking phone once per every 10 minutes.
         <br>
         <br>
         However thereâ€™s always a catch. Wrong utilization of technology can cause a lot of distress in the society especially among youngsters. Constant addiction to video games, Facebook, Instagram, etc leads to inactiveness which can cause many health issues such as brain and heart diseases, high sugar, obesity and in extreme cases , mental problems, depression, death, accidents, destructive behaviour and suicide.
         <br>
         <br>
         Crimes are increasing day by day, whereas most of them are increasing as new technolgy is invented. Crimes like cyber bulling, phishing, etc. occurs quite frequntly as they are most popular amoung the ones familiar with the technology. Many people lifestyle has also been changed as people often don't go outside because they rather stay inside along with there phones and enjoy the internet which effects the health of a person.
         <br>
         <br>
         Technology is like a double-edged sword and we must utilize it properly. Therefore, we must use technology wisely and use the modern technolgy properly and neglect the bad things that can occur due to advanced technology like crimes, bad habits and so on.
